# Misogynistic Tweets Classifier

A prove of concept tool that enables non-ML experts to carry out ML operations and enabling the users to interpret the prediction results easily. The application is built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/), intergrating supervised machine learning model. More information about the model can be found under the Acknowledgement section. 

# Proposed Pipeline 


# Future Roadmaps
Future research can investigate ways to scale the system, including adding more deep-learning models, expanding its application to new domains, and deploying the models via REST APIs so that the front-end can be developed using a more modern front-end framework.

# How to run the application 
1. Clone the project
2. Download the word vector and place it in pages/vectors
3. In terminal, streamlit run Home.py
